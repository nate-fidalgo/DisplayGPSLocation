This is an app for android phones that computes your GPS location , Bearing direction , Speed of movement, and Altitude from earth.
Though Geologist would argue that the Altitude from the GPS sensors arent truely a good approximation to the earths altitude. I have to agree with 
the geologist on that but its a crude altitude from the sensor. A much better way to measure altitude is with avionic equipment used in planes basically
a form of radar. However the GPS lat/longs should be good to within 16 feet ish or so they say. Which to me it seems reasonable accurate from what i have 
tested with it. So hopefully you build , customize , and use/enjoy/improve it.
